# SEAM Surrogate Modeling Course

![](SEAM_Logo_2025-01.png)

## Overview  

This repository contains materials for an introductory course on "Surrogate Modeling and Design Optimization," originally developed for the Shared Education in Artificial intelligence and Machine learning (SEAM) professional development program at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). It features the `surmod` Python package, which implements core techniques including Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNNs) and Gaussian Processes (GPs) as surrogates, basic Bayesian Optimization (BO) for design optimization, and Sensitivity Analysis (SA). Weekly workflow scripts in the `scripts` directory demonstrate these methods in practice. Example datasets included in the `data` directory are used to support hands-on learning and experimentation.  

Information about the SEAM program is available to employees of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory at https://seam.llnl.gov

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
TODO: Change the link once it is a GitHub repo. 
```bash
    git clone https://lc.llnl.gov/gitlab/seam/surmod.git
    cd surmod
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**
```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
```

4. **Install dependencies**
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Install the `surmod` package locally**
```bash
    pip install -e .
```
